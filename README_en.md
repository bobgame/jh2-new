# Introduction

"All the heroes in the world come from our generation. Once entering the rivers and lakes, time rushes by. The ambitions of hegemony and power fade away in laughter and talk, not even worth a drunken dream in the mortal world." What is the rivers and lakes? It is about upholding justice, avenging wrongs, singing and drinking freely, and chatting about heroes! Where is the rivers and lakes? Where there are people, there is the rivers and lakes. The rivers and lakes are in our hearts! Beyond the green mountains and blue sky, where isn't the rivers and lakes?
